### Project

FindAFriend is a product developed by the Startup FindAFriend where you can find your ideal lifestyle pet! 🐶

At FindAFriend, NGOs register the pets available for donation and brief characteristics like: size, energy level, level of independence, sociability and gender.

When entering the application, the adopter can filter the pets according to their preferences and lifestyle.
Afterwards, just get in touch with the NGO to schedule a visit and personally meet your perfect match!

FindAFriend believes that every pet deserves a comfortable and safe life. Therefore, it creates solutions that help NGOs and protective entities connect adopters to rescued animals. Currently, the company has received a major investment from an animal medicine industry and now needs to evolve its only active product - FindAFriend, to meet the investor's expectations.
